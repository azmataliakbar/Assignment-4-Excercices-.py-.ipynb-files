Program: Mass to Energy Converter
---------------------------------
This program continually reads mass input from the user in kilograms
and calculates the equivalent energy using Einstein's famous formula:

    E = m * c^2

Where:
- E is energy in joules,
- m is mass in kilograms,
- c is the speed of light in meters per second (299,792,458 m/s).

It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations, user input handling,
and the use of constants in Python.
